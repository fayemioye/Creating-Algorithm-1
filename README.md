# Creating-Algorithm-1

## Objective
Brief Objective

To develop an algorithm that parses a file containing IP addresses that are allowed to access restricted content and removes addresses that no longer have access.

### Skills Learned

- with statement: efficient file handling
- open() function: opens/import files (params: file name, purpose ("r" - read, "w" - write))
- .read() method: reads files
- .write() method: writes/appends to files
- for loops: iterate over lists
- if statements: check values in lists, execute actions
- .split() method: converts strings to lists
- Compare text file contents to list elements

### Tools Used
- Python Jupyter notebook

using the .read() method to read the imported file and store it in a variable named ip_addresses.

Building a conditional statement to remove the elements of remove_list from the ip_addresses list.
